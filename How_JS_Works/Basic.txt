JS is hosted usually in some enviroment like broswer, Node server etc
V8 engine/ SpiderMonkey/ Javascript core etc - Common JS engines

Engine ==> Parser(Syntax Check) ==> Abstract Syntax Tree ==>Machine code conversion ==> Code Runs
Different Engines do things in a different way

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution context is like a box/wrapper where our code vars are stored and in which a piece of our code
is evaluated and executed
Default executon context is global context - code that is not inside any function
Execution context is like an object. So a global execution context is a global object which is a window object in browser
lastname / window.lastname is same thing.
lastname become property of window object.

every function gets its own execution context
Execution stack - stacks upon excution contexts

------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution Context object has 3 properties :
1. Variable Object (VO) - All vars and functions declarations
2. Scope Chain - all current variables object and variable object of parents
3. 'This' variable

Execution Context object is put over execution stack in 2 phases
- Creation Phase: Creation of VO, Scope Chain and This value is determined
- Execution Phase: Code of the function generated by current execution context is executed line by line


VO
1. The argument object is created , containing all the arguments that were passed to a function
2. The code is scanned for function declaration: for each function, a  property is created in the VO, pointing to that function
3. Code is scanned for variable declaration: for each variable, a property is created in the VO, and set to undefined

last 2 points are called as hoisting : functions and vars are hoisted in JS i.e they are availabe before execution phase starts
but they are hoisted in different manner. Vars are set to undefined whereas for a function , a pointer is created .

Hoisting happens at Creation phase
Hoisting works for function declaration not fucntion expression.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creation of Scope Chain: Scope chain finds where we can accessa certain variable
Each fucntion has a scope. And to create a new scope, we just need to create a new fucntion. No IF-ELSE, FOR etc might help.
Lexical Scoping : Related to position of a function. For a nested fucntion, a child function will have access to scope of parent function

var a ='Hello' ---> globla scope
first()  ---> globla scope

function first(){																							SCOPE CHAIN
	var b ="Hi"   ---->> localscope + global scope                                                            ^
	second()																								  |	
	function second(){																						  |	
		var c = "Hey!!" -->> local scope1 + localscope + global scope /// a and b are found due to scope chain|
		console.log(a + b + c);
	}
}
SCOPE CHAIN don't work in opposite direction i.e top to bottom
Use lecture 40. SCOPE CHAIN FOR MORE
IMP: Scope chain and Execution context are different 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'This' Keyword - each and every execution context has its own this variable
It is stored in execution context object
- For a regular function: this keyword points to the global object(window object in browser)
- Method call- this object points to the object that is calling the method
IMP: this varible is not assigned a value until a function where it is actually defined is called.
