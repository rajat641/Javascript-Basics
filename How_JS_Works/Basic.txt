Execution context is like a box/wrapper where our code vars are stored and in which a piece of our code
is evaluated and executed
Default executon context is global context - code that is not inside any function
Execution context is like an object. So a global execution context is a global object which is a window object in browser
lastname / window.lastname is same thing.
lastname become property of window object.

every function gets its own execution context
Execution stack - stacks upon excution contexts

1. Variable Object (VO) - All vars and functions declarations
2. Scope Chain - all current variables object and variable objeect of parents
3. 'This'
