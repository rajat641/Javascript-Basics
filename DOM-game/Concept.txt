JS interact with HTML: DOM Manipulation
DOM: Document Object Model
structured representiton of an HTML Doc
each HTML block has an object in DOM. We cna interact with that object and change it through JS code.

JS and DOM are different things
DOM MANIPULATION ==> HTML CHANGE
We change DOM through methods so there are objects attached to it. we call it Document object.
Document object gives access to DOM and we can manipulate the HTML.

HTML/CSS Basics
<div class="wrapper clearfix"> -> div is an attribute
alt, id, class -->attribute
div vs id difference--> id has to be unique whereas div can be same throughout the page
CSS--> rules to style the webpage.
we connect HTML to CSS using class/id. Most common is class name.

--------------------------------------
query selector works similar to CSS
select the ID and change its text content
 The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Events: Notifiction that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.
 Example: Clicking a button, resize a window, switching a tab, pressing a key.
 Event listner(functions only): A function that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific evernt to happen.
 Like show a pop up, doing some animation.

 How are events processed ?
 All events are sit inside a message queue.
 Events can execute as soon as the exection stack with exection context is empty. i.e all functions have returned

global exectuion context is always there in stack.

events are picked from the queue and their execution context is put on the stack

----------------------------------------------------
Anonymous fucntion - that diesn't have a name
function(){}
It can only be used where its called
--------------------
Arrow function

-------------------------------------------
getElementById works faster than querySelector
DRY- Don't repeat yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------
To change CSS, Never use style many timer. Rather use add/remove/toggle classes.
State variable tells state of the systems
Game playing or not playing--> we have to maintain its state
Any function has access to global scope or scope of its parent

getElementById is better supported than querySelector

- textContent uses straight text, does not parse HTML, and is faster
- innerHTML parses content as HTML, so it takes longer.
-innerText Takes styles into consideration. It won't get hidden text for instance.
- textContent can prevent XSS attacks.
XSS attack - insert malicious code i.e HTML that can be threat to a system.
