structured representiton of an HTML Doc
each HTML block has an object in DOM. We cna interact with that object and change it through JS code.

JS and DOM are different things
DOM MANIPULATION ==> HTML CHANGE

Document object gives access to DOM and we can manipulate the HTML.

HTML/CSS Basics

alt, id, class -->attribute
